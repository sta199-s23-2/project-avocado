However, one per data set is required.)\nMain question: How do AIG (Academically or Intellectually Gifted) students in Durham Public Schools Perform depending on the subject categories of the standardized test? \nIn Durham Public Schools, is there correlation between performance on a standardized test for a specific subject and identifiers such as race, gender socioeconomic status?\nDoes standardized test performance vary by county/school district in Durham?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nWe are interested in finding out if there is consistency in how AIG performance in Durham Public Schools varies based on subject. More specifically, do most AIG students in Durham Public Schools tend to perform better in one subject over another? Our hypothesis is, since Western society considers math proficiency to be linked to intelligence, there will be a greater percentage of designated AIG students in Durham Public Schools Who perform at a higher level on math standardized tests compared to reading and other categories. \nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nIn order to answer our research question, we will need to look at a combination of categorical and quantitative variables. Performance level on standardized tests is a categorical variable with values such as “College and Career Ready” and “Grade Level Proficient.” Subject is also a categorical variable. Percentage of AIG students will be a quantitative variable."

Political Research Quarterly, 0(0). https://doi.org/10.1177/10659129231154914\nThis research article is written by Sarah Treul who co-published the dataset Primary Barriers to Working Class Representation which we hope to utilize in our research. Her research seeks to answer how working class candidates fare in primary elections given that working class candidates are a minority on the ballot compared to white-collar candidates. The research article analyzed occupational backgrounds of primary election candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives from 2008 to 2016 with election results. Treul et al. found that from 2008 to 2016, working class candidates are 31% less likely to win elections and tend to score 24% less votes than white collar candidates. In their analysis, Treul et al. suggests that lower success in primary elections for the working class may be due lower funding and negative bias among party leaders towards working class candidates. \nThis article uses the Primary Barriers to Working Class Representation dataset to analyze election results based on whether the candidates were working class and then analyzes factors that affected why working class candidates did not win elections. Our research would seek to understand how working class candidates overcame barriers to winning primary elections by analyzing factors that were outliers among candidates that did win the election. \nNC School Performance (2016-2017)\nFord, J. E., & Triplett, N. (2019, August 19). E(race)ing Inequities | How race influences who is designated ‘gifted’ in North Carolina. EducationNC. Retrieved March 7, 2023, from https://www.ednc.org/eraceing-inequities-the-state-of-racial-equity-in-north-carolina-public-schools/ \nFord and Triplett sought to understand racial disparities among the Academically or Intellectually Gifted (AIG) designations in public school students in North Carolina. They found that among students with AIG in Math designations, Asian and White students were overrepresented and in AIG in Reading Asian, White, and Multiracial students were overrepresented. Overall, Black students and American Indian students were underrepresented in the proportion of students designated as academically and intellectually gifted. By their proportion in the student body, there should be 6,200 more Black students designated as AIG in Math. Ford and Triplett chose to conduct this analysis because of the positive impact of gifted and talented programs on students’ plans and career successes post high school. With low representation of students of color in the academically and intellectually student population, students of color are likely being disadvantaged when it comes to education post-high school and career advancements.\nOur research also seeks to use North Carolina educational data on academically and intellectually gifted students, but rather than studying these statistics through the lens of racial differences we hope to analyze whether students designated AIG in North Carolina tend to have certain AIG designations in certain categories such as math or reading over others. This question hopes to dig deeper into whether there is a bias in designating students thriving in a particular  academic area such as math as being academically or intellectually gifted overall."

Social Science & Medicine, 280. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113969 \nThis article examines community and state-level factors that affect gun violence in the United States. In order to gain a better understanding of gun violence as a public health issue, the study looked at county and state-level predictors of gun violence rates and gun-related casualty rates. Data sources for this study included the Gun Violence Archive data from 2014-2017, which is the same archive but prior to the dataset we are using. The study found that community and state-level factors do affect gun violence specifically gun violence is higher among counties that had high median incomes and also high levels of poverty. However, poverty levels did not appear to be correlated with gun violence rates in counties with low median incomes. Factors such as institutional racism and police presence may influence the associations between community level factors and gun violence. \nOur research will use the Gun Violence Archive but rather than looking at community and state-level factors that affect gun violence we will be analyzing the time and location of gun violence incidents and how these factors affect the level of injury and death rate. There is no causation between time and location and death rates, but there may be correlations, for example if there are fewer operating ambulances in one county at a particular time of day, that could lead to an increase of death rates from gun violence."

    "text": "The data set came from a journal published at Political Research Quarterly (2023). The authors were Eric Hansen, who is the assistant professor of political science at Loyola University Chicago and Sarah A. Treul, an Associate Professor of political science at UNC.\nThe authors collected, recorded, and analyzed novel data describing the occupational background of all candidates who competed in the U.S. House primaries between 2008 and 2016.\nThe dataset was used to give us an idea of how well candidates perform in U.S. House primary elections. In total, there are 7869 observations and 24 variables. Each observation represents a candidate who competed in the U.S. Hour primaries between 2008 and 2016. Each row of observation included a variety of factors related to election results, such as vote share, fundraising, incumbency status, education level, ideology, number of opponents, and political affiliation. Not all variables are useful in terms of predicting the candidate’s performance as some of them are only numerical descriptions of vote share.\nThis research question is important for the following reasons. Given that the working class is less represented among high-level elected government officials, we would like to encourage research dedicated to this issue in order to identify factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Research in this area has focused on the barriers hindering working-class representatives. As a result, we do not know much about what factors allow working-class elected officials to overcome these barriers to election and thus, what factors influence their positive performance. We have decided to focus our research on working-class officials who have been elected to office as a case study. Results from our research would provide valuable insight to future working-class candidates. Ultimately, we hope this project can provide insight to future working class candidates providing more guidance to their campaign strategies and fundraising efforts. As a result, we hope this could contribute to more equality and equity in the government.\n– Hansen, Eric R.; Treul, Sarah A., 2023, “Replication Data for: Primary Barriers to Working Class Representation”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YGT1KX, Harvard Dataverse, V1; Treul_Hansen_Codebook.pdf [fileName] Dataset: Hansen, Eric R.; Treul, Sarah A., 2023, “Replication Data for: Primary Barriers to Working Class Representation”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YGT1KX, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:LlOCRMLIvjECWBDwtT+Xdw== [fileUNF]\nMethodology\nVariables Selection:\n\nDependent variable: candpct, which represents the candidate's vote share in the primary election.\nIndependent variables: We select the variables that potentially measure factors related to the candidate's vote share. These selected 14 independent variables include:\n\n\nstate_abbrev (the state the candidate is from)\ncandnumber (count of opponents in the candidate's primary election)\ncand_party (the party of the candidate)\nquality_cand (0=candidate is nonquality nonincumbent, 1=candidate is quality nonincumbent, 2=candidate is incumbent)\nqualnumber (count of quality opponents)\nopenseat (whether the incumbent is running for reelection)\npartyDonors1 (count of donations candidate received from donors to their party's national campaign funds)\ncollege (percentage of the congressional district's residents who hold four-year college degrees)\ndist_income (median income of the congressional district)\ntotal_primary (total dollars contributed toward a candidate's campaign funds and outside spending, unit: millions of dollars)\nthird (whether candidate runs as a third party or independent)\ngop (whether the candidate is Republican)\nideo_extreme (absolute value of Bonica's CFscore measure of candidate ideology)\nformer_worker (whether the candidate used to be a worker but is no longer now)\n\nResults\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\ncandidate <-
