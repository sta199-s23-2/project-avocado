More specifically, do most AIG students in Durham Public Schools tend to perform better in one subject over another? Our hypothesis is, since Western society considers math proficiency to be linked to intelligence, there will be a greater percentage of designated AIG students in Durham Public Schools Who perform at a higher level on math standardized tests compared to reading and other categories. \nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nIn order to answer our research question, we will need to look at a combination of categorical and quantitative variables. Performance level on standardized tests is a categorical variable with values such as “College and Career Ready” and “Grade Level Proficient.” Subject is also a categorical variable. Percentage of AIG students will be a quantitative variable."

EducationNC. Retrieved March 7, 2023, from https://www.ednc.org/eraceing-inequities-the-state-of-racial-equity-in-north-carolina-public-schools/ \nFord and Triplett sought to understand racial disparities among the Academically or Intellectually Gifted (AIG) designations in public school students in North Carolina. They found that among students with AIG in Math designations, Asian and White students were overrepresented and in AIG in Reading Asian, White, and Multiracial students were overrepresented. Overall, Black students and American Indian students were underrepresented in the proportion of students designated as academically and intellectually gifted. By their proportion in the student body, there should be 6,200 more Black students designated as AIG in Math. Ford and Triplett chose to conduct this analysis because of the positive impact of gifted and talented programs on students’ plans and career successes post high school. With low representation of students of color in the academically and intellectually student population, students of color are likely being disadvantaged when it comes to education post-high school and career advancements.\nOur research also seeks to use North Carolina educational data on academically and intellectually gifted students, but rather than studying these statistics through the lens of racial differences we hope to analyze whether students designated AIG in North Carolina tend to have certain AIG designations in certain categories such as math or reading over others. This question hopes to dig deeper into whether there is a bias in designating students thriving in a particular  academic area such as math as being academically or intellectually gifted overall."

Instead of looking at the general picture, we want to focus on candidates who won the election and pin down the two most important factors. This research question is important given that working class often has a harder time representing themselves at higher levels of government. We hope this projcect can provide insight to future working class candidates regarding things they need to pay extra attention on, and as a result, there could be more equality and equity in the government.\nWe hypothesize that the incumbent status and the amount of money contributed to the candidate’s campaign would be the two most influential factors in contributing to a larger share of vote for working class candidates. We also hypothesize that these two variables have an interaction, where more money was put into the campaign when the candidate is an incumbent. A quality nonincumbent candidate would also put into more money than a nonquality nonincumbent candidate.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThe dependent variable is the vote share, which is a quantitative variable. The two independent variables hypothesized at this moment to be the most influential are the incumbent status and amount of money contributed to the candidate’s campaign. The incumbent status variable would be categorical (0: nonquality nonincumbent, 1: quality nonincumbent, 2: incumbent) variable, and amount of money would be a quantitative variable."

Her research seeks to answer how working class candidates fare in primary elections given that working class candidates are a minority on the ballot compared to white-collar candidates. The research article analyzed occupational backgrounds of primary election candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives from 2008 to 2016 with election results. Treul et al. found that from 2008 to 2016, working class candidates are 31% less likely to win elections and tend to score 24% less votes than white collar candidates. In their analysis, Treul et al. suggests that lower success in primary elections for the working class may be due lower funding and negative bias among party leaders towards working class candidates. \nThis article uses the Primary Barriers to Working Class Representation dataset to analyze election results based on whether the candidates were working class and then analyzes factors that affected why working class candidates did not win elections. Our research would seek to understand how working class candidates overcame barriers to winning primary elections by analyzing factors that were outliers among candidates that did win the election."

Social Science & Medicine, 280. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113969 \nThis article examines community and state-level factors that affect gun violence in the United States. In order to gain a better understanding of gun violence as a public health issue, the study looked at county and state-level predictors of gun violence rates and gun-related casualty rates. Data sources for this study included the Gun Violence Archive data from 2014-2017, which is the same archive but prior to the dataset we are using. The study found that community and state-level factors do affect gun violence specifically gun violence is higher among counties that had high median incomes and also high levels of poverty. However, poverty levels did not appear to be correlated with gun violence rates in counties with low median incomes. Factors such as institutional racism and police presence may influence the associations between community level factors and gun violence. \nOur research will use the Gun Violence Archive but rather than looking at community and state-level factors that affect gun violence we will be analyzing the time and location of gun violence incidents and how these factors affect the level of injury and death rate. There is no causation between time and location and death rates, but there may be correlations, for example if there are fewer operating ambulances in one county at a particular time of day, that could lead to an increase of death rates from gun violence."

Her research seeks to answer how working class candidates fare in primary elections given that working class candidates are a minority on the ballot compared to white-collar candidates. The research article analyzed occupational backgrounds of primary election candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives from 2008 to 2016 with election results. Treul and Hansen found that from 2008 to 2016, working class candidates are 31% less likely to win elections and tend to score 24% less votes than white collar candidates. In their analysis, Treul and Hansen suggests that lower success in primary elections for the working class may be due lower funding and negative bias among party leaders towards working class candidates.\nThis article uses the Primary Barriers to Working Class Representation data set to analyze election results based on whether the candidates were working class and then analyzes factors that affected why working class candidates did not win elections. Our research would address the other side of this in seeking to understand how working class candidates overcame barriers to winning primary elections. This is important since it helps to complement existing literature by offering another perspective on factors affecting working class candidates’ election results. Meanwhile, it offers more direct insights into what working class candidates could consider to predict and increase their vote share.\n\n\nMethodology\nAnalysis Procedure:\n\nTo start off, we filter the dataset, as shown in the code and description in the “Data Cleaning” section above.\n\nWe chose multivariate linear regression as our methodology to answer the research question because we were looking for a method that determines the relative strength of explanatory variables and finds trends in data with respect to our response variable (candpct).\n\nWe use the forward and backward model selection method to compare and choose the variables that best predict the dependent variable. We choose to use stepwise selection (forward and backward model selection) method because it helps find the best fit model. During the stepwise selection, we use step AIC in the forward and backward model selection to choose the best-fit model, in which lower AIC suggests better fit and preferred model. Analyzing the AIC values is important because it quantifies which variables are most predictive.\n\nSpecifically, for the forward selection, we first try to fit each variable in a linear regression model with a single independent variable and find out which fits the best (the one with the lowest AIC). Then, we try to add each variable into the existing best model. Theoretically, we repeat this process by trying to add more variables and compare the AIC until we find the best model. Since the number of variables is too large, we use the stepAIC method in R to perform the forward model selection. We choose the stepAIC method because it can be used to simplify the model of choice without reducing its predictive capabilities, which is consistent with our goal. Based on the result of the stepAIC, we get a best-fit model from the forward selection.\nTo confirm we are using the best model selection methods, we use the stepAIC method to perform the backward model selection and produce a best-fit model.\nFrom the models produced from the forward and backward selection, we select the model with the lowest AIC value. Using our selected model, we conclude the most predictive variables related to the vote share and the coefficients of these factors.\n\nUsing the selected variables, we run an interactive multiple linear regression model to see which of the additive and interactive model works better. Based on the results, we select the model with the lower AIC.\nLastly, to make the results more straightforward and readable, we visualize the results. We choose the top three predictive variables (the top three variables with the highest coefficient,which indicate they are more powerful and decisive factors) in our final model, and use ggplot in R to create a visualization including two dot plots that shows the relationship between the three variables and the response variable (the candidates’ vote share in the primary selection). We choose to use a side-by-side scatterplot because it helps to visualize the relationship of all three explanatory variables and the response variable in a single visualization. As a note, since our top three variables are all numerical, to make the graph more direct and informative, we group the variable candnumber (count of opponents) into small pools (1-3 opponents) and large pools (4 or more opponents). In our final visualization, our x-axis represents median income of the congressional district($100k), y-axis represents vote share in primary election (%), while the side-by-side graphs are based on candnumber.\n\n\n\nResults\ncommented-out codes are used here to save space; reference the appendix for the generated outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best-fit model from the backward selection process has an AIC of -1236.62.\n\n\n\nThe best-fit model from the forward selection process has an AIC of -1221.48.\nSelected model: We ended up choosing the model from the backward selection method because it yielded a lower AIC, indicating that the model is better, and had fewer variables than the best model generated through forward selection. The variables included in the model are candnumber, quality_cand, qualnumber, openseat, dist_income, total_primary.\nlm(formula = candpct ~ candnumber + quality_cand + qualnumber + openseat + dist_income + total_primary, data = candidate_final)\nWe then picked the top three variables: candnumber, dist_income, total_primary.\n\n\n\nAIC for interaction model: -447.1903 Since the AIC for the interaction model is much larger than the additive model we get from the backward selection, we will stick to the additive model.\nConclusion: The interactive multiple linear regression model gave us a worse AIC, -447, which was higher than 1236.62. Therefore, we will keep the original additive model.\nBecause the backward selection model gave us six variables, to choose the top three most prominent factors, we looked at their coeifficients. The three variables with the largest coefficients were: dist_income, which is the median income of the congressional district in $100K, total_primary, which is the total campaign funds and outside spending in millions, and number of candidates.\nThe generated outcomes (reference appendix) tell us that with one unit ($100k) increase in the congressional district’s median income, holding other variables constant, there is on average a 0.14525 percentage decrease in the candidate’s vote share. With one unit (1 million dollar) increase inthe total campaign funds and outside spending, there is on average a 0.16772 percentage increase in the candidate’s vote share. Lastly, every time there is one more candidate in the same election, there is, on average, a 0.11032 percentage decrease in avergae in the candidate’s vote share.\nIn short, among all the variables in the dataset, we have found the three factors with the most explanatory power. We have found that a candidate’s performance is positively correlated with total campaign funds and outside spending but negatively correlated with the median income of the congressional district and the number of competing candidates.\nThe following visualization incorporates all three of the variables with the most explanatory power. Candidate number has been mutated into a large pool and a small pool of candidates, enabling their faceting and visualization on the graph. Campaign funds are visualized by color, with an increase in warmth as funds increase. Finally, median income of the congressional district in $100k is on the x-axis, leaving our response variable, vote share (%), on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussions\nWhile our hypothesis predicted total_primary, quality_candidate, and qual_number as best explanatory variables for working class candidate success, our linear regression found dist_income, total_primary, and candnumber to best predict candidate success. This means that as we predicted, the money contributed toward a candidate’s campaign funds positively influences a candidate’s success. Additionally, the median income of the congressional district negatively influences a candidate’s success, demonstrating that social class associations with candidates are important. Although we predicted that the number of quality candidates would be negatively correlated with success, the total number of candidates is, indicating that the quality of opponents does not matter as much as the number of them.\nThe variables that we analyzed that are predictive of working-class success in elections may be predictive of success but do not cause candidates to win elections. Thus our research is limited to establishing correlations rather than causations. This is important to note because even in addition to the variables we are studying there are other factors, some that cannot be quantified that contribute to a candidates success in an election. Even with our results outlining what variables are most predictive, this does not mean that in every election these will be valuable factors in a candidate’s success. Future research should collect and explore data on other factors that could potentially impact working class candidate success to form a more accurate prediction model. Future research could also try to determine causation rather than correlation if possible. Our research has limited applications because some factors that contribute to a candidates success such as income level or college education are not factors that can be changed when working a campaign strategy, yet understanding the importance of these variables can help candidates choose how to shape their own campaigns. Future research could focus specifically on the efficacy of specific campaign strategies given the demographics of the candidate’s congressional district, which would be more straightforward in helping real-life campaign organizations.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nDependent variable: candpct, which represents the candidate’s vote share in the primary election.\nIndependent variables: We select the variables that potentially measure factors related to the candidate’s vote share. These selected 14 independent variables include:\n\n\nstate_abbrev (the state the candidate is from) – categorical\ncandnumber (count of opponents in the candidate’s primary election) – quantitative but later factored into categorical\ncand_party (the party of the candidate) – categorical\nquality_cand (0=candidate is nonquality nonincumbent, 1=candidate is quality nonincumbent, 2=candidate is incumbent) – categorical\nqualnumber (count of quality opponents) – quantitative\nopenseat (whether the incumbent is running for reelection) – categorical\npartyDonors1 (count of donations candidate received from donors to their party’s national campaign funds) – quantitative\ncollege (percentage of the congressional district’s residents who hold four-year college degrees) – quantitative\ndist_income (median income of the congressional district) – quantitative\ntotal_primary (total dollars contributed toward a candidate’s campaign funds and outside spending, unit: millions of dollars) – quantitative\nthird (whether candidate runs as a third party or independent) – categorical\ngop (whether the candidate is Republican) – categorical\nideo_extreme (absolute value of Bonica’s CFscore measure of candidate ideology)\nformer_worker (whether the candidate used to be a worker but is no longer now) – categorical\n\nThe variables we drop or do not use in our analysis:\n\nworker_current_recode (binary indicator for whether the candidate was a worker) (We drop it because it is not an influential factor for our research question, and the “worker” variable is a more accurate indicator for us to choose the working class candidates.)\nrace_id (unique identifier for each candidate contest) (We drop it because this is an identifier and is not an informative variable)\nyear (the year of the election the candidate participate in) (We drop it because it is not an informative variable for us to understand and predict the vote share for working class candidates)\ndem_vote (vote share for the Democratic candidate in the most recent presidential election) (We drop it because we are not interested in dividing up the candidates by party in the scope of this project)\ncandvotes (total number of candidate’s votes received) (We drop it because candvotes/tvotes = candpct, and we only need candpct as the response variable) \ntvotes (total number of votes case for all candidates) (We drop it because candvotes/tvotes = candpct, and we only need candpct as the response variable) \nIdeo_extreme (absolute value of Bonica’s CFscore measure of candidate ideology) (We drop it because around half or more of the observations have N/A for ideo_extreme, which would affect the feasibility and accuracy for the linear regression)\nqualbin (there is no formal definition for this variable in the codebook or the source article, so we drop this variable)\n\nRunning Results\n\n\n[1] 312\n\n\n\n\nStart:  AIC=-1214.94\ncandpct ~ state_abbrev +
